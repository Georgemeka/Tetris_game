I created my own version of the popular Tetris game using Javascript
Tetris Game
This is a classic Tetris game implemented in Javascript. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript, and runs in the browser.

Game Play
The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by clearing lines of blocks. The game is played using the following keys:

Left Arrow: Move the tetromino left
Right Arrow: Move the tetromino right
Down Arrow: Move the tetromino down
Up Arrow: Rotate the tetromino
Space Bar: Drop the tetromino to the bottom of the screen
The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

Installation
To run the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. No installation is required.

Future Improvements
Some potential improvements to consider for the game:

Adding sound effects and background music.
